                        Kartus is a chatbot hosted on the Discord messaging platform. Initially developed to simplify the complex daily schedule for students into a quickly accessible and visual format, Kartus quickly evolved to accommodate several features to solve the real
                        problems I observed myself and the students around me facing in real time. At a time where all classes were held online, and there a palpable disconnect among the audience attending the same lectures and dealing with the same coursework,
                        Kartus helped students with shared faculties and similar courses find each other on Discord, using the data it collected in order to visually formulate the user schedules.
                        <br>
                        <br> The main motivation behind the project was to make online college easier, and I was able to do this by implementing solutions to the problems I faced in real-time as I went along. Kartus is a passion project which gave me
                        a great deal of satisfaction as it was immensely helpful to my friends and other students in my batch. The project, however, was dropped around the commencement of physical classes.

                    My name is Abbas Roshan. I am currently an undergraduate student at VIT Chennai. I'm, at present, learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript and planing to learn react.js next. I keep myself stimulated by regularly solving problems on platforms like CodeChef and
                    HackerRank. I enjoy the process of identifying problems and drafting algorithmic solutions to them. I am always keen on learning newer things and challenging myself. I am particularly interested in web development, competitive programming,
                    ethical hacking and penetration testing. I believe that my genuine passion for coding, my willingness to work on compelling projects and my ability to grasp new languages will all make me a valuable addition to any team as a programmer.
